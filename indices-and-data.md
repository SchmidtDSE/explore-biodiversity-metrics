# Biodiversity Intactness Index

> BII is defined as the average abundance, across a large and functionally diverse set of species, relative to their reference populations

First proposed in [_Science_ (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1259855), first data-based estimate in [_Science_, (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf2201) (based on PREDICTS)
