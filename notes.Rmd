Population data appears to be mostly (~ 90%) count data, not abundance estimates

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/7012670")
df |> count(Units, sort=TRUE)

df |> mutate(abundance = grepl("[Aa]bundance", Units)) |> count(abundance)
```


Greatest number of species (rows) come from `{Sauer, 2012 #3261}`, which I think must be <https://doi.org/10.3996/nafa.79.0001>.
This is actually abundance data (birds), though most other examples are all pure counts.
Studies are supposed to control for sampling methodology, thus supposedly justifying the assumption on average that trends in counts are trends in abundance.
